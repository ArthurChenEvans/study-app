# Study App Designs

Clickable HTML prototype of every MVP screen, built with the `studyapp` DaisyUI theme from `docs/design-rules.md`. Open `index.html` in a browser. The dark bar in the bottom right switches each screen between its states.

## Screen inventory

| Screen | States | Requirements | Feature files |
|---|---|---|---|
| Topics | normal, empty, delete confirmation | R1, R2, R3, R30 | topics |
| Question editor + source preview | normal, error (no correct option), no file open | R4 to R12, R14 | questions, sources |
| Bibliography | normal, empty, add source | R13 | sources |
| Quiz setup | normal, error (no topic picked) | R15 to R19 | quiz-setup |
| Quiz | study (with feedback), exam, timer low, incomplete multi-answer | R18 to R23, R29, R32 | taking-quiz |
| Results | normal, perfect (nothing to retry) | R24 to R26 | results, retry |
| History | normal, empty | R26, R27, R29 | history, retry |
| Search | normal, no results | R31 | search |

Open questions from `specs/README.md` are shown in place as dashed blue "Open Q" badges instead of being designed: Q1 (unreadable files), Q2 to Q4 (quiz setup limits), Q5 and Q6 (study mode), Q7 (guessed count), Q8 and Q13 (history), Q10 to Q12 (sources), Q15 (single/multiple switch), Q16 (search tabs).

## Review checklist results

Checked with screenshots of every screen and state, including a greyscale plus blur squint pass.

**Fixed during review**
- Topic table actions wrapped onto two lines and columns didn't line up between modules. Now a fixed column layout.
- Review list dividers rendered near-black. Now base-300.
- Selected option in segmented controls (Study/Exam etc.) was nearly invisible in greyscale. Now uses the neutral solid style.
- Shortcut hints inside dark buttons were unreadable. Now outlined in the button's text colour.
- Diagram text fell back to a serif font when IBM Plex wasn't loaded. Now falls back to sans-serif.

**Passing**
- Squint and greyscale: score, current question and primary action stand out on every screen. Correct, wrong and guessed all have an icon and a word as well as colour.
- Contrast: all theme text pairs pass AA (see design rules). Field borders use the 3.9:1 field-border shade.
- One primary button per screen and dialog.
- Quiz works by keyboard alone: 1 to 5, Enter, F.
- Nielsen's 10: status (timer, progress, file slide count), real-world words, cancel on every dialog, error prevention (disabled add/remove at 3 and 5 options, delete confirmation, disabled submit with nothing picked), recognition (topic list with counts in setup), shortcuts, plain error messages with the fix.

**Known gaps**
- Fonts, Lucide, KaTeX and Shiki load from CDNs. The real app should bundle them for offline use.
- The source preview is a mock slide, the real one is PDF.js.
- Search filters and sorting are shown but not interactive.
